## About Me

Hi, I am Adit. I have two passions:
1) Learning
2) Understanding the nature of the Universe.

I am a software engineer. I am fascinated by the evolution of intellingence. This, combined with my love for linear algebra means that
I am also really interested in Machine Learning (especially Deep and Reinforcement Learning).

I am also interested in physics, and neuroscience. I have not figured it out yet, but I have a gut feeling that my interest in all these
areas is inticately linked together. At some level, it's me trying to understand the natrue of the Universe.
